# Music Genre CNN
 This repository contains work from a project in my neural networks class at NC State. Our goal was to create a music genre classifier for the GTZAN dataset. To do this, we converted audio snippets to spectrograms and fed the magnitude plots of these spectrograms to a convolutional neural network.
